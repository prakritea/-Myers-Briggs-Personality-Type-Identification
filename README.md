# 🧠 Myers-Briggs Personality Type Identification
*Personality Prediction, Analysis, and Career Counselling Using MBTI*
🧩 Overview

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of the most widely used personality classification systems in the world. It categorizes people into 16 unique personality types based on four psychological axes:

Introversion (I) ↔ Extraversion (E)

Intuition (N) ↔ Sensing (S)

Thinking (T) ↔ Feeling (F)

Judging (J) ↔ Perceiving (P)

For example, a person who is an Introvert, relies on Intuition, prefers Thinking, and tends toward Perceiving would be classified as an INTP.

In this project, we explore how natural language patterns can be used to predict MBTI types based on users’ writing styles, offering potential applications in:

🔍 Psychological Research

💼 Career Counselling

📊 Behavioral Analysis

🤖 AI-based Personality Prediction

📚 Background

The MBTI is inspired by Carl Jung's theories of cognitive functions and typology. It has evolved into a popular framework used by:

Businesses for team building

Individuals for self-discovery

Researchers exploring behavioral science

Online communities for discussion and fun

Despite ongoing debates about its scientific validity, MBTI remains relevant and widely used. This project leverages a data-driven approach to test how well we can predict personality types based on written text.

📦 Dataset

🧾 Total Records: 8,600+ individuals

✍️ Data Format:

Type: The 4-letter MBTI personality type (e.g., INTP, ESFJ)

Posts: A collection of 50 posts written by the person, separated by "|||"

🧠 Data Source: PersonalityCafe Forum
 — a community where users self-report their MBTI types and discuss personality-related topics.

🎯 Project Objectives

🔍 Analyze writing styles and linguistic features across personality types

🤖 Build ML/NLP models to predict MBTI types from text

📌 Note

While MBTI is a popular and widely-used framework, it is important to understand its limitations and contextual relevance. This project is meant for educational and exploratory purposes and does not claim to provide clinical psychological assessments.
